# Rise: Pitch Deck

> **Visual Programming Meets Clean Code**  
> **Bridging the gap between no-code builders and AI coding tools**

---

## 🎯 Slide 1: The One-Liner

### Rise: Where Vibe Coding Meets Professional Development

**The next generation of developers shouldn't have to choose between:**
- Visual control vs. AI generation
- Clean code vs. easy prototyping
- Ownership vs. convenience

**Rise gives them all three.**

---

## 🔥 Slide 2: The Problem

### The Current Market Has a Critical Gap

#### Option A: Pure Vibe Coding (Loveable, v0, Cursor)
✅ AI generates complex code instantly  
✅ Natural language interface  
❌ **Costs $2 every time you want to "center that div"**  
❌ No visual controls for simple edits  
❌ Hard to make precise visual adjustments

#### Option B: Low-Code Builders (Bubble, Noodl, Webflow)
✅ Visual interface for everything  
✅ No coding required  
❌ **Proprietary runtime (vendor lock-in)**  
❌ Can't export real code  
❌ Monthly hosting costs even for POCs

#### Option C: Traditional IDEs (VS Code + Copilot)
✅ Full control, any framework  
✅ Clean code output  
❌ **Requires coding knowledge**  
❌ No visual design tools  
❌ Slower iteration for UI work

### The Gap
**Nobody offers: AI generation + Visual refinement + Clean code output**

---

## ✨ Slide 3: The Solution

### The Hybrid Approach That Changes Everything

```
        AI GENERATES              USER REFINES            EXPORT CLEAN CODE
    (Complex structures)      (Visual tweaking)        (Take it anywhere)
            ↓                        ↓                         ↓
    "Create a login form"    Click to center div      Standard React files
    Component hierarchy      Adjust colors            Zero vendor lock-in
    Logic flow scaffolding   Fine-tune spacing        Production-ready
```

### The Core Insight

**Stop paying AI $2 to center a div.**  
**Stop being locked into proprietary runtimes.**  
**Start building with the best of both worlds.**
